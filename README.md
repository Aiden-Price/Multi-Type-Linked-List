The purpose of this project was to create a multi-type linked list data structure and a program that interacts with it
    • The first part is the basic command syntax of the linked lists, creation, removal, viewing etc.
    • The second part is modifying the lists in place, through insertion and deletion of elements.
    • The third part is allowing lists to refer to each other in a nested pattern.
